# WLED_HA
WLED basic integration with HomeAssistant


This is my way of controlling additional features of WLED via the HomeAssistant frontend (lovelace).  Theres probably much more attractive ways to accomplish this, but this is what I've come up with.  I am by no means a HA / LoveLace / programming veteran of any kind, this is just what I've mustered together to accomplish what I needed.

Prerequisites:

WLED - you need WLED flashed to an ESP board of your choice obviously
